Week 1: Ruby Homework
=====================

This is the week 1 homework for a class I'm teaching as an intro to web
development.

The student should create a class that meets the following requirements

* Create a Blog class
* It should have a .add_post method that takes a string for content and a string for author
* It should have a .total_posts methods that returns the total number of posts
* It should have a .authors method that returns an array of all the authors (bonus points if you can eliminate duplicates)
* It should have a .posts method that returns an array of content

Drop your blog.rb file into this directory then run:
  ruby -Itest homework_test.rb
to check your answers

If you want to try the bonus, run this:
  ruby -Itest bonus_test.rb
